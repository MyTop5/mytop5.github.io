      <description>&lt;p&gt;I became a book reader when I was in 3rd grade, and our teacher started a &amp;ldquo;book club&amp;rdquo; to get everyone excited about books and reading in general. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember the details, but I believe that she talked to all of the parents and passed the hat around to buy the first books for our class.
The first book I was assigned to read was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/295.Treasure_Island&#34;&gt;Treasure Island&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/854076.Robert_Louis_Stevenson&#34;&gt;Robert L. Stevenson&lt;/a&gt;, which was a perfect match for an 8-year-old boy with a wild imagination and thirst for adventures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
